## Abstract

Much like the greater continent, Tanzania has a large informal sector. More than 3 million
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) exist and represent ninety-five percent
(95%) of all businesses in the country.

Without formalization, financial services such as loan services becomes inaccessible as the
majority of financial institutions require formalization as a prerequisite.
The Small Industries Development Organisation is a parastatal organisation under the
Ministry of Trade in the government of the United Republic of Tanzania that provides a
host of services; among them business consultancy (including for formalization) and
provision of loans to MSMEs.

This project aims to address these two principle problems: the difficulty in the formalization
process and the management of loan application for microfinance institutions.

It begins with an investigation of the problem in terms of formalization and financial services for MSMEs in Tanzania. This investigation involves studying current solutions to these problems in a literature review and determining the best methodology to develop this project.

A further investigation was done for requirement specification which involved interviews
with stakeholders such as MSME owners and officials at the Small Industries Development
Organization (SIDO) to ascertain the requirements that would adequately solve the
problems to be addressed.

With these requirements, a detailed design of the proposed system of this project was
developed that are geared towards solving the aforementioned problems. This design
includes an architectural design of the system, design of the database, and preliminary
UI/UX interface sketches.

## SIGNIFICANCE

MSMEs in the informal sector need to formalize so that they can legally gain access to
financial services, business development services and technologies that will allow them to
grow.

This solution will be vital for these informal firms in helping them commit to the
process of formalising their business. It will make the entire process of formalisation easier
and more accessible.

The system will prepare businesses through each process of formalisation and assist them before they begin application at the respective authorities.

Society will benefit greatly as formalisation will be opened up to even more businesses that
will give employees better rights as formally employed workers. The government will
benefit from increased tax revenue from even more registered businesses. In short, the
economy will grow from this endeavour.
